    "\n",
    "1) Increasing productivity by improving efficiency eg using new technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Improve price modeling strategies eg using a price elasticity model that adapts to demand \n",
    "\n",
    "See eg. https://github.com/kyramichel/Data_Science/blob/master/MarketingMix%20PriceElasticity.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Improve quality to justify price increase eg by improving customer experience eg see https://github.com/kyramichel/Statistical_Testing/blob/master/A_B%20Testing.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "and increase spending on true innovative research.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Use optimization tools to reduce debt while considering acquisitions eg acquiring property, new equipment, staff with skills or acquire a competitor if that means reduction in overhead and expansion into new markets or ability to offer an expanded array of services\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Improved forecasting capability eg using Machine Learning/AI as we need to make predictions about the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to monitor know how stagflation effects on the businesses in order to make the right decisions at the right time \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- to know ahead of time when the next episode of economic decline occurs eg by monitoring the economic environment. A business that can successfully adapt to stagflation may be able to better position if the economy enters recession\n",
